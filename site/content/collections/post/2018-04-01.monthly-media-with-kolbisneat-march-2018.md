<p>We are officially 25% through 2018 and that amazes me. Here’s how I spent the month of March (aside from eating, sleeping, working, and taking pictures of my cat.)</p>
<p><b>……….FILM……….</b></p>
<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-width="958" data-orig-height="700"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/0a4ca2f0309adf5619abcae02440e60b/tumblr_inline_p6duwrDNm21qdydna_500.jpg" alt="image" width="500" height="365" data-orig-width="958" data-orig-height="700" /></figure>
<p><b>Lady Bird </b>(2017)<br />
This one really challenged me from the start and I think it was the combination of how foreign the highschool experience was (to me) while also feeling so realistic and honest. It almost felt like an invasion of privacy to be seeing some of the scenes unfold. Really really beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Train to Busan </b>(2016)<br />
The best. Horror is not my bag (especially not zombie flicks) but I always appreciate when a filmmaker uses the scary elements for character development instead of cheap gore. The characters were compelling (including a surprising villain) and be prepared for 2 hours of tension. I couldn’t believe how they could keep up the stress for that long but they did it.</p>
<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-width="1232" data-orig-height="900"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/658b988bdef0b70f5e356a83b4a629ee/tumblr_inline_p6dux4RZU61qdydna_500.jpg" alt="image" width="500" height="365" data-orig-width="1232" data-orig-height="900" /></figure>
<p><b>Spider-Man: Homecoming </b>(2017)<br />
The exchange between Peter and Aaron Davis/Donald Glover is still my favourite moment of the movie and nicely rounds up the theme of the movie: Peter has to get better if he’s going to keep doing this. In re-watching this I realize I like my Marvel movies like I like my Marvel comics: light on crossover and not bogged down by super high stakes.</p>
<p><b>Mamma Mia </b>(2008)<br />
If you ever get the chance to go to a sing-along screening of this film, do it. The film is 10x better than it already is when you have a theatre full of beach balls and bubbles blowing around (oh yeah it was interactive too!)</p>
<p><b>……….TELEVISION……….</b></p>
<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="1079"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/27e9728fba5ccf7a2cfe5dd053a93ac5/tumblr_inline_p6dvb7B6Oz1qdydna_500.jpg" alt="image" width="500" height="539" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="1079" /></figure>
<p><b>The Good Place </b>(Episode 1.01 to 1.07)<br />
I have so many theories to all the questions I have. Number one is that I think the lies go beyond just Eleanor. It’s taken a bit to get into this but Janet is my rock and may she never change.</p>
<p><b>Riverdale </b>(Episode 2.14 to 2.17)<br />
My partner mentioned that this show is going full-on soap opera with the long lost twins (plus actors being swapped out in roles without hesitation) and I couldn’t agree more. This show is a teen soap and I love it.</p>
<p><b></b><b>Cowboy Bebop</b> (Episode 1.22 to 1.26)<br />
I suppose it’s appropriate how melancholic I felt after completing the series. I’m surprised I didn’t spoil the ending for myself while researching the watch order (I decided I’ll watch the movie after the end of the show and I’m glad I made that call). Those last few scenes are really going to stick with me and I’m still amazed at the range of stories these characters told over 26 episodes. Ugh that scene with Punch from Big Shot in the airport? I’m really glad this series is out there.</p>
<p><b>The Bachelor </b>(Episode 22.09 to 22.12)<br />
Drama! I shouldn’t be surprised that Arie would thoroughly screw up his season by waffling around. He never struck me as someone who had a clear sense of self and that was made even clearer with the finale and its aftermath. Also I was totally surprised at Becca becoming the Bachelorette buuuuuuut that’s because I still partially believe everyone is on here to find love.</p>
<p><b>The Bachelor Winter Games </b>(Episode 1.04 to 1.05)<br />
While it doesn’t quite make it to <i>Terrace House </i>levels of great, I really do prefer the Bachelor shows that give everyone a little more agency (as opposed to 20 people vying for one person’s heart). It would’ve been nice if we were shown more of Courtney and Lily’s perfectly reasonable relationship and I can’t believe Luke is such a crummy dude! I had a huge crush on him during Jojo’s season but it’s all gone now.</p>
<p><b>……….READING……….</b></p>
<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-width="892" data-orig-height="700"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/34f854a89b0e543e88b4676403420775/tumblr_inline_p6dvoygfh11qdydna_500.jpg" alt="image" width="500" height="392" data-orig-width="892" data-orig-height="700" /></figure>
<p><b>Elminster: The Making of a Mage </b>by Ed Greenwood<br />
(Complete)<br />
Since it’s a book set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, you might not be surprised at how inspiring it might be for someone running the game. The main antagonist isn’t a single villain but a cabal of wizards lording over the realm and it’s super cool. What’s not cool is the fact that there are maybe…2 female characters. It always amazes me when fantasy writers can easily work in spells and dragons and all this lore but can’t make a well-rounded character that isn’t a prostitute or a goddess.</p>
<p><b></b><b>A Darker Shade of Magic </b>by V. E. Schwab<br />
(Complete)<br />
This is a tough one to express. The closest parallel I have is some of the weaker Marvel movies: the protagonists are interesting and charming, the villains are thinly drawn, and the final conflicts don’t have the same weight because of it. I just found some of the resolution to be too easily achieved, but I still recommend it.</p>
<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-width="488" data-orig-height="700"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/87241d98678da3af7168af014a846364/tumblr_inline_p6dvr1iSXj1qdydna_500.jpg" alt="image" width="488" height="700" data-orig-width="488" data-orig-height="700" /></figure>
<p><b>Delicious in Dungeon</b> by Ryōko Kui<br />
(Complete)<br />
It’s been a while since I’ve finished reading something and immediately wanted to go out and buy the next volume but this does it. The premise is one part D&amp;D and one part Great British Bake Off and the whole thing is great. The tone is light with enough danger to make the conflicts have weight, and the characters are all well established by the end of volume 1. I can’t wait to dig into the next chapter!</p>
<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-width="936" data-orig-height="700"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/b89aa4f7092f1f596f02decab8d6d3a5/tumblr_inline_p6dvp6qOiZ1qdydna_500.jpg" alt="image" width="500" height="373" data-orig-width="936" data-orig-height="700" /></figure>
<p><b>Ultimate Spider-Man Ultimate Collection 1 </b>by Brian Michael Bendis &amp; Mark Bagley<br />
(Complete)<br />
I read through this series starting back in 2009 and was one of my introductions into comics. Despite the heavy nostalgia, it holds up pretty well. There’s some disappointing gender stuff and a lot of the references feel dated, but the characters and initial arc is still strong. Still a solid Peter Parker story, if you’re looking for one.</p>
<p><b>Ultimate Spider-Man Ultimate Collection 2 </b>by Brian Michael Bendis &amp; Mark Bagley<br />
(Complete)<br />
Continuing with the series, volume 2 is still pretty solid but heavily features a version of the Green Goblin that I never liked. He’s depicted as a roided up hulk monster and slowly devolves into a purely physical threat. It’s a bummer cause the first volume focuses on Spider-Man learning to use his brains along with his powers and then presents a villain that strictly requires punching. It’s a misstep.</p>
<p><b>……….AUDIO……….</b></p>
<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-width="1006" data-orig-height="500"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/ccc885037ea5ce2cfc7b4c9b2890a65a/tumblr_inline_p6dvuaTvfi1qdydna_500.jpg" alt="image" width="500" height="248" data-orig-width="1006" data-orig-height="500" /></figure>
<p><b>Mouth Moods </b>by Neil Cicierega (2017)<br />
If the internet was a movie then this album would be its soundtrack. I’m a sucker for a good mashup album and even more so when there are memes and humour involved. This…isn’t going to be everyone’s taste, but if you dig it then please recommend anything else you think I might enjoy.</p>
<p><b>This is Love</b> (Podcast)<br />
There are just six episodes in the first season and each one presents a unique perspective on the topic of love. It’s a wonderful dose of positivity and I can’t recommend it enough.</p>
<p><b>……….GAMING……….</b></p>
<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-width="1966" data-orig-height="2523"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/c880e3a41f38ae33f518905d16e0d90a/tumblr_inline_p6dvxjAWEI1qdydna_500.jpg" alt="image" width="500" height="641" data-orig-width="1966" data-orig-height="2523" /></figure>
<p><b></b><b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Hexcrawl Campaign </b>(Wizards of the Coast)<br />
So this party is obsessed with pets. I don’t get it, but I’m slowly learning to embrace it. Sure there are grand plots with villains and monsters or unexplored ruins of ancient temples but they will spend so much time trying to figure out a way to hoodwink the owner of the local shelter (since they’re all on the blacklist). Oh also they defeated a mummified crocodile.</p>
<p>And that’s it! As always, let me know if you have any recommendations based on what you see here and have a great rest of the weekend!</p>
